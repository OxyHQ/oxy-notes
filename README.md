# Oxy Stack

**Oxy Stack** is the foundational app of the Oxy ecosystem ‚Äî a unified base that integrates all core services, UI components, and SDK functions from [`@oxyhq/services`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oxyhq/services).  
Use this app as a starting point to explore, test, and build with the full Oxy stack.

## üöÄ Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Then choose how to run it:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

## üìÅ Project structure

Start editing files in the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) with [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router/docs).

## üîÑ Reset the app

To start fresh and move the example code aside:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will archive the starter code into `app-example/` and create a clean `app/` directory.
